## UIFramework
A powerful UI framework for the game Nanos World. Ported from the Other game. [Original Repo](https://github.com/FlowPX3/UIFramework)

#### Why should I not use the Nanos World WebUI directly?
Of course you can also use the WebUI directly and have more possibilities.
But sometimes with a good UI framework you get awesome results a lot faster and easier, so you have more time to develop the main logic of your extension.
Another point is that no HTML or CSS knowledge is required for this UI framework, but if you have knowledge of HTML and CSS, the framework can easily be extended with new features.

#### No documentation, seek into Client/ files to watch classes methods or uiframework-tester for examples.
